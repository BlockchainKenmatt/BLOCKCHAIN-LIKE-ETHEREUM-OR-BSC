Introduction

Welcome to my repository, where I'm building a complete blockchain platform from scratch, inspired by the likes of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This project aims to create a decentralized, open-source blockchain network, enabling the development of smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and innovative use cases.

Goals

- Design and implement a scalable blockchain architecture
- Develop a robust consensus algorithm (e.g., PoW, PoS, or Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
- Create a virtual machine for executing smart contracts (e.g., EVM or WASM)
- Implement a decentralized storage solution (e.g., IPFS or Filecoin)
- Develop a user-friendly wallet and explorer
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Technical Stack

- Programming languages: C++, Rust, or Go
- Blockchain framework: Custom implementation or fork of an existing framework (e.g., Ethereum's Geth or BSC's Tendermint)
- Consensus algorithm: To be determined
- Smart contract language: Solidity or a custom language
- Virtual machine: Custom implementation or adoption of an existing VM
- Storage solution: To be determined

Roadmap

- Research and planning: Completed
- Blockchain architecture design: In progress
- Consensus algorithm implementation: Upcoming
- Smart contract development: Upcoming
- Virtual machine implementation: Upcoming
- Wallet and explorer development: Upcoming
- Testing and debugging: Ongoing
